# The Charity Scrape Project 

## Introduction 
As part of my wish (at the time) to work for good causes, I was initially looking to utilise my skills in Data Analytics, Science, Engineering and Machine Learning for them. However, I wanted to use these skills on a consultancy basis for charities and non-profits that I believed were doing the right thing; in other words to "help people, who help people".  

As part of this goal I wanted to understand how i could acquire the relevant details of these organisations for me to approach and see if they needed any assistance with their data needs.

The reason for wanting to get into this potential business venture, was due my previous experience dealing with some consultancies, where have targeted charity organisations that get little support in this area, and charge unfairly for their services. Not only this, but also tend to attempt to inaugurate themselves into the organisations structure, which in my head poses two problems:

1. Charging high fees (up to Â£2,000 per day for a senior consultant - based on my exposure), that takes much money away from the charity's intended cause.
2. Provide the most basic service for such high fees, providing little training or support in any new practice they provision.
3. With such provisions, place them in a position, where the charity cannot function in the same way without them going forward, becoming dependant on the consultancy.

These things above I wanted to change entirely:
- Charge fairly, enough to ensure my needs are met (bills have to paid still!) but at a fraction of the price above, saving at least 60% or more in comparison.
- Tailor to what they need, based on real situations that affect them day to day, to save money , time and stress in the long run.
- Help those we work with learn and improve the ways of working with the use of data.
- Upskill and learn from one another on what is best both short and long term.
- Allow the Charity to be self sustaining once the work is done, so there is no need to depend on someone like me in future! More, they have the option to collaborate in future (if I did a good job!)
